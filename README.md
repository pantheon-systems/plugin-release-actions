### Prepare Dev
This action will update the development branch to be ready for the next release after releasing a new version of a plugin or module. This action search and replaces the version number across all the top-level files in the repo.

### Release PR
This action will draft a "ship it" PR to the `release` branch when new features are added to the development branch. This action search and replaces the version number in relevant places across all the top-level files in the repo.

This action expects to make use of the label "automation" on the repo. Create it if it does not already exist.

## Merging Commits
_TBD explain why features should be squashed and releases must be merged._
